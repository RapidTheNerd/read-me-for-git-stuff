# General
Soooo you probably noticed I have about 11,000 commits. Yeah about 7000 of those falsely generated. Why? Well a lot of the things I do are designed to push the limits of things and I decided to do it on git. Finding out that you can edit past times with certain values of git I made a little HTML/JS script that allowed me to do so on certain dates.
