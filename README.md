# General shit about my git
Generally the stuff on public is just random projects i have made because I'm bored
My main projects are kept under private repos due to following reasons
1) They're requests
2) Stuff i don't want released
3) I don't want it released

Majority of the projects i work on are uploaded to git

My main languages are C# and Java anything like Python, Node/JavaScript will probably be sloppy
I highly recomend you don't steal any of it because it will probably break your server.

# My weird commits
Not all of my commits are legit lol. I got bored one day and found a picture of someone who had a made their contributions look like something on the lines of "I <3 GITHUB" it looked really cool and i wanted to challenge myself to do the same or something similar. So i did, and it took a bit of a wrong turn so yeah. 

# Using the stuff here

If it's public feel free to do what the hell you like with it, bare in mind I wont provide support for it.
Anything under a license (normally GNU or MIT) please follow the licenses provide for it, sometimes ones that are licensed
have some form of support for it.
