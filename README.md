# MY GIT AND STUFF
Generally the stuff on public is just random projects i have made because I'm bored
My main projects are kept under private repos due to following reasons
() They were paid projects
() Software i don't want the code being leaked
() Stuff i generally want private

My main languages are C# any code like Java, Python, Node/JavaScript will probably be sloppy
I highly recomend you don't steal any of it because it will probably break your server.
